# matpad


## Install

```bash
$ bun install
```

## CLI

there are two apps, the matpad app is run by

```bash
$ bun source/matpad.js
```
this creates a little notepad, kinda like heynote

and also calcli app, run by

```bash
$ bun source/calcli.js
```

the calcli app is closer to wolfram, and is just a simple repl wrapper for mathjs
